# Code accompanying "Dynamic Neural Relational Inference"

This codebase accompanies the paper ["Dynamic Neural Relational Inference"](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/html/Graber_Dynamic_Neural_Relational_Inference_CVPR_2020_paper.html) from CVPR 2020.

This code was written using the following packages:
- PyTorch 1.2.0
- numpy 1.16.4
- transforms3d 0.3.1 (For Motion Capture data processing)
- pandas (for InD data processing)

To run this code, you should pip install it in editable mode. This can be done using the following command:

`pip install -e ./`

Scripts train models can be found in the `run_scripts` directory.

Datasets:
- Motion Capture: the datasets can be downloaded from http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/search.php?subjectnumber=118 
  and http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/search.php?subjectnumber=35. For subject 35, you need trials 1-16 and 28-34.
  For subject 118, you need trials 1-30.
- Basketball: The original data can be accessed here: https://github.com/ezhan94/multiagent-programmatic-supervision. Some preprocessing has been done to get it used into the form used by this code; for convenience, these files can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x4243T1TOymrvTJKV5D7S2pQFS-mSwxf/view?usp=sharing).
- InD: Data must be requested from here: https://www.ind-dataset.com/
- Synth: this code includes the synth data, as well as code used to generate it.
